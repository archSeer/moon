## Introduction
Moon is a experimental prototyping 2D Game Engine written in C++ and scripted using [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby).


## Supported
Currently testing is done linux, moon may not run or even compile on other systems. If you managed to get Moon running on your system, please open a PR and share your changes to get it built.


## Requirements
While moon attempts to vendor most of its dependencies, here is a list of 
things you'll need before getting started.


### Dependencies
```
# building
cmake >= 2.8.12
ruby >= 1.9.2
  yard (for docs)

# runtime
OpenAL
OpenGL

# For dependency docs
doxygen

# for mruby-yaml
yaml
```

## Support

We support graphics cards with OpenGL 2.1 support and the following extensions:

- GL_ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex
- GL_ARB_vertex_array_object

Cards that support OpenGL 3.0+ naturally support these extensions, because they
are a part of the OpenGL 3.x series. (We basically use a 3.0 context with only
the things we need that are widely supported on 2.1 cards so we have wider support).

We will make no effort to support anything less than 2.1.

## Building

```shell
# if you don't already have moon locally
git clone --recursive https://github.com/polyfox/moon.git

cd moon
# if you don't have bundler installed
gem install bundler
# make sure you have all the nice things moon needs to build
bundle update


# finally execute the build process and watch it go
bundle exec rake build

# alternatively you can do this, which is done by the `rake build`
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The build process is still clunky and your build may fail.

Here are a list of ENV variables you may be interested in

| VAR                    | Description                              | Default |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `MOON_STATIC_GLFW`     | Statically link GLFW into the build      | `false` |
| `MOON_MRUBY_TOOLCHAIN` | Which toolchain should mruby build with? | `gcc`   |

Example:

```shell
MOON_MRUBY_TOOLCHAIN=clang MOON_STATIC_GLFW=ON bundle exec rake build 
```

## Updating
You can update Moon at anytime by grabbing the latest commits from master
and updating the submodules if needs be:

```shell
git pull origin master
# in case we added new submodules, you can initialize them during the update
git submodule update --init
```


## Mruby
Moon is broken into 4 mrbgems, `system`, `graphics`, `audio`, `engine`.
`graphics`, and `audio` require `system`, while `engine` requires the other 3.

Moon's `graphics` and `audio` can be used in your own projects outside of moon.
